    <h1>Starting Out</h1>
    <p>
      First off, we need to figure out how much weight we're going to lift for each exercise.
      We need to know our weights so our workouts and ultimately, our progress can be trackable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the exercise is 10 reps, you want to find a weight with which you will fail at 15 reps in a single set.
      Chances are, we won't get this perfect the first try, however, we only need an approximation.

      <h2>Warmup</h2>
      <p>A) About a five minute light cardio activity, just enough to feel warm and start to sweat a little.</p>
      <p>B) Dynamic stretching routine:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Worldâ€™s Greatest Stretch</li>
        <li>Prayer Stretch</li>
        <li>Eccentric Curl Up</li>
        <li>Goblet Squat Stretch</li>
        <li>KB Windmill</li>

      <h2>Primer Exercises</h2>
      <p>
        These tempos are going to be painfully slow, and you're going to have to relearn what working out is all about.
        This is going to teach you how to move your body and how to really dig in to the muscle fibers.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are definitely going to want to use much lower weight than you would normally think you should.
        For the leg exercises, you might only need weight for the two deadlifts. Start at the low end of the
        rep ranges and work your way up over the weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do 2 sets for each exercise and do each workout twice a week.<br>
        ie: Mon: Lower, Tue: Upper, Wed: cardio, Thurs: Lower, Fri: Upper, Sat: cardio, Sun: off
